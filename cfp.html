            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>The annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented
                conference, complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD
                and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR gathers researchers and
                practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss the latest innovative and visionary ideas
                in the field.
            </p>
            <p>We invite contributions on novel approaches to data management systems, architecture, and
                usage including cloud based systems for data processing as well as related system issues such as
                data storage, networking, hardware acceleration, custom processors, memory hierarchies,
                processor interconnects, etc. in the context of data processing. We also encourage new
                approaches to data management and system building based on or in support of ML/AI
                technologies. CIDR encourages contributions about innovative and risky data management
                system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insights, resourceful experimental
                studies, and provocative position statements. CIDR especially values innovation, experience-based
                insight, and vision.
            </p>


            <p>CIDR 2026 invites two kinds of contributions:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Papers (at most 6 pages). We invite both regular research papers and more visionary
                    papers that promote interesting ideas and ongoing work.</li>
                <li>Demos (a video or a description of the demo in at most 6 pages).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>To encourage authors to submit only their best work, <span style="color: #D22B2B"><b>each person can be
                        an author or co-author of at most <i>one</i> submission of any kind</b></span>. Authors who feel
                their work is best captured through a demo should submit a demo proposal. Demos and papers will be
                interweaved in a single-tracked program.
            </p>

            <p>Papers, and demos will be reviewed by the program committee, who will select the final program
                in co-operation with the organizing committee.
            </p>

            <p>The number of participants at CIDR is limited to allow an intimate single-track experience. In
                the past, CIDR reached maximum capacity several weeks before the conference. As in the past,
                registration for the 2026 conference will be carried out in two phases. Authors who co-authored a
                paper or demo submission are invited to register first. Then, registration is on a first-come-first-
                serve basis until the conference capacity is reached. <span style="color:#D22B2B"><b>Please note
                that timely registration and in-person attendance by at least one author is mandatory for each
                accepted paper or demo</b></span>.
            </p>


            <h3>Submission</h3>

            <p>Papers should be electronically submitted in PDF format to
                <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CIDR2026">CMT</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Similarly to previous years, conference submissions must be formatted using the
                <span style="color: #D22B2B"><b>double-column ACM sigconf style</b></span> (see the
                <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Template</a>), and
                <span style="color: #D22B2B"><b>must not exceed 6 pages in length including all
                        references and appendix</b></span>.

                Videos can be submitted in HTML or MPEG format. Submissions will be reviewed by the program committee
                which will make acceptance and rejection decisions. Final versions of accepted submissions will be
                published in the electronic proceedings of the CIDR conference and by the VLDB Endowment. The final
                versions of accepted papers and demos have no page limit and can be significantly expanded from the
                submitted form. At least one author of an accepted paper or demo will be expected to attend the
                conference in person to present the paper. For accepted papers and demos with several co-authors, the
                program committee reserves the right to select the co-author who should present the paper at the
                conference as a condition of acceptance (this typically means a senior author will be chosen as the
                presenter).
            </p>

            <p>The <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com">Microsoft CMT service</a> is used for managing the
                peer-reviewing process for this conference. This service was provided for free by Microsoft and they
                bore all expenses, including costs for Azure cloud services as well as for software development and
                support.
            </p>

            <h3>Camera-Ready Guidelines</h3>

            <p>Camera-ready papers need to follow the formatting instructions above. Additionally, they need to include
                the following copyright notice at the bottom left of the first page:

            <h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>

            <p>As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different
                backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) are crucial for the data management
                community. Please refer to <a href="https://dbdni.github.io/">D&I in DB</a> for the details of the
                coordinated D&I efforts across our community. Paper writing can make a material difference. So, we would
                like to strongly plead with the authors to follow the <a
                    href="https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting.html">D&I writing instructions</a> when
                drafting the paper submissions.
